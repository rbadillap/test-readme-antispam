# AI README Antispam Demo

Live demonstration of my action [rbadillap/ai-readme-antispam](https://github.com/rbadillap/ai-readme-antispam) - an action that detects and prevents spam README edits.

## Try It (carefully ðŸ˜…)

Open a PR modifying this README and watch the AI analyze it! Spam PRs are automatically closed.

See the workflow: [`.github/workflows/spam-detection.yml`](/.github/workflows/spam-detection.yml)
